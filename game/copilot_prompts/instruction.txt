Review the items under "Objects". Drawing from that list as well as any 'expected' items, Create 20-30 object passages and place in 10_objects.twee with naming convention obj-item-description.
Objects
vehicles
games
farm tools
normal tools
old fridge
trunks
computers
scarecrows
wine bottles
safe
rifle
suitcases
fishing pole 
junk
Trash
burn pit 

Let's do two more things: 1) Remove the non-exiting passages from 10_objects.twee 2) Use a consistent convetion with links of [[description->passage_name]]

Perfect. Now let's take each object passage from 10_objects.twee and place a link to that object in one and only one appropriate location. Use the convention of [[object description->object passage]]. Place the object link ABOVE any existing links in the target passage


Create a twee file to hold passages for game characters. Each character passage name should be of the form char-firstname-lastname. Generate at least 12 characters. Create character names using the fictional names of popular characters from 1980's television shows that were associated with crime or law enforcement or mystery. The descriptions should describe the character's physical appearance and wardrobe and not their profession or personality
